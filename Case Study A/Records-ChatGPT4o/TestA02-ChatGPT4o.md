The visualizations, such as scatter charts and device error lists, are clear and provide actionable insights at a glance. Overall, the system's design enhances its usability and efficiency for managing building security.

13. **User:** Is there anything you are expecting to see which is absent?

    **ChatGPT:** As a house manager, I would expect to see the following features which are currently absent:
    - **Interactive Maps:** Visual maps showing real-time status and alerts for each room.
    - **Historical Data:** Access to historical trends and data for environmental conditions and device performance.
    - **User Customization:** Options to customize alerts and notifications based on personal preferences or priority levels.
    - **Maintenance Schedules:** Integrated schedules for regular maintenance checks and reminders.
